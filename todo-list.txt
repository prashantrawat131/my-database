---------------------------------------Todo list starts here---------------------------------------

-> Call the rebuildIndex function in a seperate thread.

-> Create function to rebuild the database. For example: to completely remove the deleted keys.

-> Check for duplicate key reinsertion and create another command names update which will override the previous key's value.

-> Write seperate methods for parsing keys and values from char arrays.

-> KEY_ALREADY_PRESENT not working properly.
