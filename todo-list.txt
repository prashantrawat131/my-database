---------------------------------------Todo list starts here---------------------------------------

-> Call the rebuildIndex function in a seperate thread.

-> Create function to rebuild the database. For example: to completely remove the deleted keys.

-> Check for duplicate key reinsertion and create another command names update which will override the previous key's value.
But put will not override anything just return key already present when an attempt is made to reinsert a existing key.

-> Check if in put method key or value is null or not.

-> KEY_ALREADY_PRESENT not working properly.

-> Remove the params part from db.cpp and directly pass the key and value as string. Leave the params part to cmd.cpp
